# Maliba-Scene-Chunks
Maliba Scene Chunks is a powerful and lightweight Unity package that streamlines the process of loading and unloading scenes dynamically based on contextual triggers. By utilizing load zones, this package ensures an optimized and seamless experience, allowing for unnoticeable transitions between scenes. (Inspired by Bonelab's patch 4 update)
